Our project creates a harmony from a melody. We wrote an algorithm to take in the Soprano and it outputs a four-part score (including Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass). The GUI allows the user to input the melody, and our program calculates the harmony and outputs the four-part score as a pdf. 
To output the score, we used a library call Abjad, and to build the GUI we used Tkinter. 
The project was written in Python3.
